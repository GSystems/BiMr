# BiMr - Birds Migration

The idea of this project came from the the fact that are few accessible applications that allows users to see detailed informations about the human migrations around the whole world. This kind of instrument can be useful in many fields, especially in politics and economics, but everyone can have some conclusions after seeing a real-time updated map with highly interested destinations.
